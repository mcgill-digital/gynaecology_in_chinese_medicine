## DATASET/COLLECTION DESCRIPTION

Gynaecology in Traditional Chinese Medicine consists of XML files from the digitization of a small collection of Chinese gynaecological works held by McGill University Library Rare Books and Special Collections. One of these texts is unique, others are well known works that exercised considerable influence in the practice of gynecology in late imperial China and were reprinted many times. The original digital collection project was carried out in the early 2000s and is accessible at [Gynaecology in Traditional Chinese Medicine: Selected Texts](http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/chinesemedicine).

Gynaecology was a medical specialty that developed in China in the Tang (618-907) and Song dynasties (960-1278). It is a subject that was little studied by modern scholars until recently, even though at least 349 individual works were devoted to the topic by medical doctors over the centuries. It has great potential for throwing light on the issues of the changing nature of gender relations and the understanding of the body in traditional China.
